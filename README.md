# mkv2m4v

Converts audio and video tracks from a MKV (Matroska Media) container into a
format compatible with Apple TVs.

It attempts to pass through as many codecs as possible.

* It assumes that the video track is already in H.264/MPEG-4 (Advanced Video
  Codec).
* It will convert a DTS audio track into separate AAC and AC3 tracks.
* If no DTS, it will pass through the original AAC and/or AC3 tracks.
